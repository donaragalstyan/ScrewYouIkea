## PDF Conversion Fixes Applied

The error "Object.defineProperty called on non-object" was caused by PDF.js trying to load on the server-side during Next.js SSR (Server-Side Rendering). Here are the fixes implemented:

### 🔧 **Root Cause**
- PDF.js requires browser APIs (Canvas, FileReader, etc.) that don't exist on the server
- Next.js was trying to import and execute PDF.js code during server-side rendering
- The `Object.defineProperty` error occurs when PDF.js tries to set up browser-only objects

### 🛠️ **Solutions Implemented**

1. **Client-Only PDF Utils** (`lib/pdf-utils-client.ts`)
   - Created a separate client-side-only version of PDF utilities
   - Uses dynamic imports to ensure PDF.js only loads in the browser
   - Added "use client" directive to prevent server-side execution

2. **Dynamic Component Loading** (`components/progress-modal-wrapper.tsx`)
   - Wrapped ProgressModal with Next.js `dynamic()` and `ssr: false`
   - Ensures PDF-related components only render on the client
   - Provides loading fallback during hydration

3. **Client Detection Hook** (`hooks/use-is-client.ts`)
   - Created a hook to detect when we're running on the client
   - Prevents PDF processing from starting during SSR
   - Ensures clean hydration without mismatches

4. **Webpack Configuration** (updated `next.config.mjs`)
   - Added fallbacks for browser-only APIs
   - Externalized PDF.js on server-side builds
   - Prevents bundling issues during build process

### 🚀 **How It Works Now**

1. **Server-Side**: No PDF.js code is loaded or executed
2. **Client-Side**: PDF.js is dynamically imported only when needed
3. **Hydration**: Clean transfer from server to client rendering
4. **Processing**: PDF conversion happens entirely in the browser

### 📋 **Testing**
To test the fix:
1. Upload a PDF file
2. The progress modal should load without errors
3. PDF conversion should work in the browser
4. No more "Object.defineProperty" errors

The error should now be resolved and PDF to JPG conversion should work properly! 🎉
